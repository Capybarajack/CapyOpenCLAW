- Confirmed `skills/supabase-vue` exists in workspace and restarted OpenClaw Gateway to pick up skills.
- Added persistent preference: when building Vue 3/Nuxt features backed by Supabase, apply the `supabase-vue` skill by default.

- User project context: Building a fashionable diet recommendation app. Users upload photos; app uses OpenAI Vision API to analyze and respond with nutrition components. Frontend: `F:\nodejs\protaincare` (Nuxt). Backend: `F:\nodejs\proteinCare_Backend` (Node.js).
