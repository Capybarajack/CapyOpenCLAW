# Frontend UI Playbook (Router)

Use this skill to select the right atomic skill, then continue there.

## Routing rules

1. If request is mostly visual style, layout quality, interaction polish:
   - Use `frontend-design`
2. If request asks for structured UI/UX recommendations, design-system generation, style/color/typography matching:
   - Use `ui-ux-pro-max`
3. If request asks to reuse/adapt Tailwind design-system reference code:
   - Use `tailwind-design-system`
4. If request is React-specific performance/rendering patterns:
   - Use `react-best-practices`
5. If request is browser behavior verification, screenshots, UI regression checks:
   - Use `webapp-testing`

## Output requirement

State which atomic skill was selected and why in one short line, then execute with that skill.
