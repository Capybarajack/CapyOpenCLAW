# MEMORY.md - Long-term Memory

## Preferences / Working Style
- For all future programming work: use **Codex** (CLI, `pty:true`, inside a **git repo**).
- For all future programming work: use **OpenSpec (OPSX)** as the spec-driven workflow (specs/artifacts-first) through to the end of project iterations.
- Even if the user chats in Chinese: **all instructions/prompts sent to Codex must be pure English**.
- After each completed development iteration / workflow cycle, record learnings into the **CapyOpenCLAW** skill and push updates to: https://github.com/Capybarajack/CapyOpenCLAW.git
- Also persist these workflow/skill updates into long-term memory files (MEMORY.md and relevant daily memory logs).
- When building **Vue 3 / Nuxt features backed by Supabase** (Auth/DB/RLS/Storage/Realtime, supabase-js v2): apply the **supabase-vue** skill by default.
- Current project: a fashionable diet recommendation app. Users upload photos; the app uses the OpenAI Vision API to parse the image and reply with nutrition components. Frontend: `F:\nodejs\protaincare` (Nuxt). Backend: `F:\nodejs\proteinCare_Backend` (Node.js).
- Progress (2026-02-05): Supabase tables + RLS created; Nuxt Google OAuth login implemented and confirmed working. Next: upload images to Supabase Storage (meal-photos) and persist analysis results into Supabase tables (food_entries/items, daily_summaries).
- Safety preference: **Never automatically execute** actions involving **payments/transactions/transfers**, **password changes**, or **accessing sensitive data**. Always ask for explicit confirmation first.
- High-risk operations require **manual confirmation**. Email is OK to **draft**, but **sending must be user-triggered** (user presses send).
