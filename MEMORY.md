# MEMORY.md - Long-term Memory

## Preferences / Working Style
- For all future programming work: use **Codex** to implement **Spec Kit**-based development (spec-first workflow) through to the end of the project iterations.
  - Default to running Codex via CLI with **pty:true** and within a **git repo**.
