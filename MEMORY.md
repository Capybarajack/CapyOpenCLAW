# MEMORY.md - Long-term Memory

## Preferences / Working Style
- For all future programming work: use **Codex** (CLI, `pty:true`, inside a **git repo**).
- For all future programming work: use **OpenSpec (OPSX)** as the spec-driven workflow (specs/artifacts-first) through to the end of project iterations.
- Even if the user chats in Chinese: **all instructions/prompts sent to Codex must be pure English**.
- After each completed development iteration / workflow cycle, record learnings into the **CapyOpenCLAW** skill and push updates to: https://github.com/Capybarajack/CapyOpenCLAW.git
